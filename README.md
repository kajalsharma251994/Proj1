## ðŸ“ŒProject Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize poverty rate trends across Florida counties
from 2012 to 2023 to identify geographic patterns, temporal changes, and socioeconomic
disparities by integrating U.S. Census data (ACS Table S1701) . The study aims to develop a
comprehensive data framework that enables policymakers and community organizations to
understand poverty distribution, assess intervention effectiveness, and make informed decisions
about resource allocation. By employing statistical analysis and interactive mapping tools, the
project seeks to create an accessible knowledge base that supports evidence-based poverty
reduction strategies while highlighting areas requiring targeted support.

**Methodological Approach**

â€¢ Data collection through Census API automation
â€¢ Advanced analytics with volatility indices and geospatial clustering.
â€¢ Interactive Tableau visualizations

Special care was exercised to address data quality issues, particularly the incomplete 2020 and
2024 data. The analysis also accounted for outlier instances like Monroe
county's fluctuations (8.5-19.7%) owing to its tourist economy.

**Key Findings**

The analysis revealed stark geographic divides in poverty rates. Putnam County remained Florida's
poorest, with a peak of 31% poverty in 2021 dropping to 21.4% in 2023. On the other hand,
affluent St. Johns County tied Florida's lowest level of poverty at 5.6% in 2022. The Tampa Bay
region improved significantly, as Hillsborough County reduced its poverty rate by 30.7% over
the course of the study. The results also highlighted a persistent urban-rural gap, with the coastal
counties having an average of 11.2% poverty rates compared to inland regions' 18.7%.

**Policy Recommendations**

Three intervention priorities were isolated from the findings:
â€¢ Targeted economic development programs for North Florida's poverty hotspot.
â€¢ Upscaling Tampa's successful urban poverty alleviation measures to rural areas.
â€¢ Creation of real-time monitoring systems to track program performance.
